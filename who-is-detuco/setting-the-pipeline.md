# Setting the Pipeline

First you will need to download the Dropbox desktop app if you don’t already have it.
When you have it installed, please log in with the user and password that we sent you vía mail or Slack. 
*Because the team enters from different countries, Dropbox may ask for a security code to enter. Please ask your Production Coordinator.

Then, we’ll need to set up sync and the most important thing is to have the project on a drive with the letter "P" so we can work on the same drive (same paths to keep everything linked).
With dropbox we do it as follows:

First you have to share the dropbox folder to your Network (this is only for your personal network).

Go to the **Dropbox folder on your main disk**, the username should appear inside (it can be "Litcomp Detuco" or "Animacion Detuco").
*It often happens that the computer assigns a different path to the disk, such as "Users /". In that case we would need to change the path to a main drive (C or D). To do it, go to Dropbox app, user menu, properties, Sync tab, “Dropbox folder location”, press “Move…” and select the new location directly to “C or D” Drive on your computer.

**Should look like this when is on the correct path:**

**Next step:**Right click on the folder and select “properties”.
Go to the “Sharing” tab and press “Share…”

On the new window select everyone and press add. 
As for the permissions choose read/write.

Finish this setting pressing SHARE.

Then, On the File Explorer go to “Network”

There you should be seeing your computer’s name.
In this case my computer’s name is DT-02

![Computer name.png](https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/torchpad-production/wikis/15338/BuIPe8ATvSvA1eriiolI_Computer%20name.png)

Double click to open and you should see a folder with the Dropbox username (animacion detuco or litcompo detuco)

![Dropbox folder name at network.png](https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/torchpad-production/wikis/15338/F5JFp4uRtGiCucRYAp7Q_Dropbox%20folder%20name%20at%20network.png)

Right click on the Dropbox folder and select “Map Network Drive”.

![Map network drive.png](https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/torchpad-production/wikis/15338/PWXEdbowSC6oXRib8P4Z_Map%20network%20drive.png)

On the new window select the letter P in the “Drive” options.
 
![Map P drive.png](https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/torchpad-production/wikis/15338/M7uqiZi5TheRYw3wnbs5_Map%20P%20drive.png)

Now at your File Explorer you should see the new drive “P” and the Dropbox folder inside with all its folder structure.

The main Dropbox folder is equivalent to the Maya project folder. You just need to set that the first time you open your Maya scene.

So to check that everything is okay, you should see that the project is addressed directly to "P" like this P:/MyProject. And Maya Project should be adressed to the same path. 


**One last thing:** 
When synchronizing each folder comes by default as **“online only”**, it means that nothing is downloaded but it WILL be necessary to download **the folders** that contain the files you will need. To do so, go to the Dropbox App and select the folder you want to download, right click on it and choose **"local"**.
- To know which are the folders that you will need, go to the page section according to your role: 3D Artist or Animators.

- If at any time a folder that isn’t needed is synchronized, do not delete it, simply right click on the folder and select "online only". That way, even if you see it, it won't take up space on your disk.
