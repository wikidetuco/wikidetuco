# I am an Animator

**Hi! Welcome to the team!**

We have a very simple Pipeline to set up.
We are using Maya 2018.6.
For the pipeline we are using a Dropbox folder with the structure of a Maya project so that the scenes can have all the corresponding assets referenced.

We try to keep everything referenced and not imported in animation so that you can keep everything up to date with all the fixes or changes.

[To learn how to set up the Pipeline Go Here](https://wikidetuco.github.io/wikidetuco/who-is-detuco/setting-the-pipeline.html)

## Once you have configured the Pipeline, you are almost ready! Just keep these general recommendations in mind:

- These are the main folders that you will need:
 - (projectname)/scenes/ANIM
 - (projectname)/scenes/RIG
 - (projectname)/scenes/PROPS
 - (projectname)/scenes/SET
 - (projectname)/sourceimages/TexturasAnim
 - (projectname)/movies/ANIM

And if other needs arise depending on the project, we will specify them vía mail or Slack.

- Don’t sync any subfolders with the name “Versiones”. 

**SAVE YOUR SCENES IN THIS PATH:**
(projectname)/scenes/ANIM/*scene or sequence folder*/*shot folder *

*If the scene folder doesn't exist, please create a new folder for it.

E.X: BodyArmor/scenes/ANIM/JAMORANT/T050/

**PLEASE SAVE THE PLAYBLAST IN:**
(projectname)/movies/ANIM/*scene folder
AND IF APPLIES FOR THE PROJECT, ALSO UPLOAD THEM TO SHOTGUN. How? Watch the [tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvyay4fylcbgsfv/How%20to%20upload%20versions%20to%20SG-ENG.mkv?dl=0) we have kindly recorded (eng temp unavailable). [(or Spanish version here)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sjs6aqzx9r74a5u/Tutorial_SG_Recomendaciones_01-15-2021.mkv?dl=0)
 
*Please don’t modify any of the other Dropbox folders.

**- KEEP THE VERSION NAMES IN INCREMENTAL NUMBERS** THRU ALL THE STEPS AND WITHOUT MENTIONING THE STEP: 
- Example:
anim_s01_010_v01
anim_s01_010_v20

*Also please check after every day that the last version is synced.

**- CHECK THE PROJECT SPECS**
- Ask your production coordonator which are the specs for the project.
- And as for Playblasts: QT, H264 or Photo-Jpeg, quality 100, Display Size: From Render Settings.

## HOW TO START

*If the scenes were already created, you can skip this section. 

- Open the "Base" scene that we have prepared for each set (ask the TD or the Production Coordinator which is it and its location).
- Reference characters and props that the assigned scene requires.
- Name the Camera with the naming convention for cameras (see below).
- Save as a new scene in the corresponding folder at /scenes/ANIM/*scenefolder with the naming convention.
*Note: some projects start layout and/or animation when some assets are still missing, we will let you know if something is missing and when it is ready. In the meantime, you can use placeholders like boxes.

## NAMING CONVENTION

**1. SCENES**

*If the project doesn't have sequences inside each commercial/piece, this convention might slightly change to: (Spot)_ANIM_010_v00

**2. CAMERAS**
Also starts with the piece "tank name" or abbreviation, pipeline step, then Scene Number plus frame range at the end, like this: 
cm_anim_01_010_fr_101_125__CAM (if the scene duration was 25 frames for example).

## FINALLY
**IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT CHARACTERS EYES:**
- There will surely be some notes and / or videos from the rigger explaining some controls, be sure to watch them before you start.
- Please check that the natural or neutral pose for the eyes is with the eyelids relaxed and not fully open. 
- Please use the “Blink” control and check that there’s no crosses or interpenetrations between eyelids and eyelashes or something like that. 

**ABOUT SCALING:**
- To scale a Prop or asset that has rig, please do it from the MAIN control. 
- To scale set elements please do it from the group. 
- You can hide, add, change some props or their position.

**PLEASE DON'T SCALE:**
- **Characters without asking first**, but specially avoid to scale characters that have **fur**. 
(I know you don't always have this information, so that's why it's better to ask first)
*I think it would be weird for this to happen accidentally but let's keep that in mind to double check.


**If you need anything, be it rig or whatever, please ask.**

## If you see anything strange or that seems to be wrong please ask.
